Eerste keer de applicatie automatisch de database laten aanmaken, of een volgende migratie uitvoeren:

// First time
1. Build the application to make sure there are no errors.
2. From the Tools menu, click Library Package Manager and then Package Manager Console.
3. In the Package Manager Console window at the PM> prompt enter (CHANGE TO YOUR MODEL)
Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName MVCWebApp.Models.ApplicationDbContext
The Enable-Migrations command creates a Configuration.cs file in a new Migrations folder.

// After first time
4. Build the project. (The following steps will fail if you don't build at this point.)
5. In the Package Manager Console window, enter the command add-migration %NAME% to create the migration with name %NAME%
Code First Migrations creates another class file in the Migrations folder (with the name {DateStamp}_%NAME%.cs ), 
and this class contains code that creates the database schema. 
The migration filename is pre-fixed with a timestamp to help with ordering. 
Examine the {DateStamp}_Initial.cs  file, it contains the instructions to create the table for the DB. 
When you update the database in the instructions below, this {DateStamp}_%NAME%.cs file will run and create the the DB schema.

5. In the Package Manager Console, enter the command update-database to create the database and run the (optional) Seed method.
If you get an error that indicates a table already exists and can't be created, 
it is probably because you ran the application after you deleted the database and before you executed update-database.

6. If you added a new field, make sure to check out [Bind(Include = "property, property1, etc")] attributes in the corresponding controller.
The new field might have to be added there



Seed method:
        /*
         * Instructions: http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/adding-a-new-field
         */
        /*
         * Detected database created with a database initializer. Scaffolded migration '201507240916214_InitialCreate' corresponding to existing database. 
         * To use an automatic migration instead, delete the Migrations folder and re-run Enable-Migrations specifying the -EnableAutomaticMigrations parameter.
         */
