To add support for localized dates, replace

@section Scripts {
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jqueryval")
}

at the end of a Edit.cshtml file, with

@section Scripts {
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jqueryval")
    @{Html.RenderPartial("globalizedvalidation");}
}

Shared\globalizedvalidation.cshtml contains all the needed stuff for fixing validation on a DateTime for example. But also for decimal numbers (needs tweaking).
